Module "SegLCD1"   (component SegLCD_LDD)
   - SegLCD1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - SegLCD1_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, interrupts 
                vectors, etc.
   - SegLCD1_GetEventStatus -Gets current pending flags and clears them. This method is available if the interrupt service 
                property is disabled. This method must be called in polling mode, when is called method StartFaultDetectFrame.
   - SegLCD1_SetFrontplaneData -Set data to the LCD frontplane data registers. It sets/clears all used segments.
   - SegLCD1_GetFrontplaneData -Get data from the LCD frontplane data registers.
   - SegLCD1_SetBlinking -Activates/deactivates blinking of all segments (according to parameter BlinkMode).
   - SegLCD1_SetBlank -This method sets the blank display without affecting state of each segment. If supported by the LCD 
                module, the method allows alternate display setting. A segment state is set by method SetFrontplaneData or 
                SetAlternateFrontplaneData.

Module "TSS1"      (component TSS_Library)
   - TSS1_Configure -Whole TSS initialization and configuration of registers. Contains main TSS_Init() function, TSS System 
                Config registers and all Control Config registers initialization according to setting of Component properties. 
                The user have to place this function into the proper location in the source code.

Module "LED1"      (component LED)
   - LED1_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LED1_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LED1_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LED1_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LED1_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LED1_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - LED1_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LED1_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

Module "LED2"      (component LED)
   - LED2_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LED2_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LED2_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LED2_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LED2_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LED2_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - LED2_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LED2_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

Module "MCUC1"     (component McuLibConfig)
   - MCUC1_Init -Driver initialization method
   - MCUC1_Deinit -Driver deinitialization method

Module "SW1"       (component BitIO)
   - SW1_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "SW2"       (component BitIO)
   - SW2_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "PTC"       (component Init_GPIO_VAR0)
   - PTC_Init -This method initializes registers of the GPIO module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "Cpu"       (component MKL46Z256MC4)
